# Command: RANGE

In this command is used to create a sequence of integer number.

There are three arguments:
- **stop**: create a range until "Stop":

```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

```

- **start**: start of the number 5 until stop:

```
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)
# Output: 2, 3, 4, 5
```

- **step**: Create range but I want that jump in 2 on 2 numbers.

```
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
# Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

```
