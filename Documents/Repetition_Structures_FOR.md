# Repetition Structures: FOR

It's used to execute a block of code multiple times and know how many times will be done. These structures are commonly referred to as loops.

**Example without "FOR":**

Get a number of the keyboard and exhibit the two after number.

```
a = int(input("Inform an integer number: "))

a += 1
print(a)

a += 1
print(a)
```
